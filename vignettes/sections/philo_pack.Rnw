\section{Philosophy of \pack}
\label{philo}

\subsection{What is \PPB ?}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{decentralized the selection}

When decentralizing the selection in target environment \citep{desclaux_changes_2008}, the phenotypic trait is the sum of genetic ($G$), environmental ($E$) and interaction between the two ($G \times E$) : $P = G + E + G \times E$.
Braod sens heritability of a given trait is then:
\begin{displaymath}
h^2_{sl} = \frac{var(G)}{var(G) + var(E) + var(G\times E)}
\end{displaymath}

Heritability taking into account the network is therefore superior or equal to heritability on a given site because $var(G\times E) > 0$.
When facing a wide diversity of agroecological environment and practices, decentralized breeding is a key point to select adapted variety to local agro-system.

\item \textbf{involve all actors in the breeding decision process}: farmers, technicians, researcher, facolitators, consumers ... Such involvement empower all actors and answer the real needs of actors  \citep{sperling_framework_2001}.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Objectives of \pack}

\pack~aims to set, describe and analyse balanced and unbalanced trials in decentralized participatory plant breeding programmes.
The statistical procedures are based on frequentist and bayesian approaches.

\subsection{Workflow and function relations in \pack}

\pack~is divided into two sets of functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Main functions
\item Second functions
\end{itemize}

In this vignette, we only used examples with main functions.
Nevertheless, second functions could be used in other context to answer specific questions.
Figure~\ref{main_workflow} displays the main functions and their relations.
Table~\ref{function_descriptions_workflow} describe each of the main functions.

Figure~\ref{workflow_2} display second functions used in the main functions.
Table~\ref{function_descriptions_workflow_2} describe each of the second functions.

You can have more information for each function by typing \texttt{?function\_name} in your \R~session.

\subsection{Frequentist statistics}



\subsection{Bayesian statistics}
\label{section_bayes}

The analyses performed in \pack~are based on Bayesian statistics.

Bayesian statistics are based on the Bayes theorem:

\begin{displaymath}
Pr(\theta|y) \propto Pr(\theta) Pr(y|\theta)
\end{displaymath}

with 
$Pr(\theta|y)$ the posterior, 
$Pr(y|\theta)$ the likelihood and 
$Pr(\theta)$ the prior.

The parameters' distribution, knowing the data (the posterior), is proportional to the distribution \textit{a  priori} (the prior) $\times$ the information brought by the data (the likelihood).

The more information (i.e. the larger the data set and the better the model fits the data), the less the prior would be of importance.
If the priors equal the posteriors, it means that there is not enough data or the model does not fit the data.


Bayesian inference is based on the posterior distribution of model parameters.
This distribution could not be calculated explicitely for the hierarchical model used in here (see section~\ref{section_model1} and section~\ref{section_model2}) but could be estimated using Markov Chain and Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

These methods simulate values of model parameters according to a Markov chain that converges to the posterior distribution of model parameters \citep{robert_bayesian_2001}.

MCMC methods were implemented using \texttt{JAGS} by the \texttt{R} package \texttt{rjags} that performed Gibbs sampling \citep{robert_bayesian_2001}.
Two MCMC chains were run independently to test for convergence using the Gelman-Rubin test.
This test was based on the variance within and between the chains \citep{gelman_inference_1992}.

A burn-in and lots of iterations were needed in the MCMC procedure.
In our case, the burn-in had 1000 iterations, then 100 000 iterations are done by default\footnote{You can change it with the argument \texttt{nb\_iterations} in functions \texttt{MC} and \texttt{FWH}} with a thinning interval of 10 to reduce autocorrelations between samples, so that 10 000 samples were available for inference for each chain by default\footnote{There are \texttt{nb\_iterations}/10 values for each chain. This can be changed with the \texttt{thin} argument of the functions.}.
 
The final distribution of a posterior is the concatenation of the two MCMC chains: 20 000 samples.

\subsection{Let's go!}
To continue, load the package:
<<message=TRUE,cache=FALSE>>=
library(PPBstats)
@
and download from internet the data used in this vignette (this is useful to earn lots of time!) :

<<message=FALSE,cache=FALSE,eval=FALSE>>=
get.PPBstats.data() # not run
# |=======================================================================| 100%
# The data are downloaded in ./data_PPBstats/ 
# You can now load the data, for example load("./data_PPBstats/out1.Rdata").

%The example in this vignette were performed with a computer with 4 Gb of memory and the following processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4210M CPU @ 2.60GHz.
%This gives an idea about memory and processor needed to run the analysis.
