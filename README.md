## Participate to development

You can participate in three ways:

1. test this development version and report bugs
2. translate the package
3. add new functions that may be useful in the analysis of unbalanced trials that can be found in PPB programmes

If you update the code, you can refer to 
[the issues](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/issues)
and do it in on the [branch v0.10.1](https://github.com/priviere/PPBstats/tree/v0.10.1)
so that the master branch remains unchanged for tests.
Anyhow, send me an email if you wish to participate in order to coordinate our efforts!


### 1. Test and report bugs

First, load the development version:

  `
  devtools::install_github("priviere/PPBstats")
  `

The easiest way to start is to look at the vignette to know how the package works.

You can see the vignette [here](https://github.com/priviere/PPBstats/blob/master/vignettes/PPBstats.pdf). You can download it by clicking on 'Raw' in the top right corner.

Do not hesitate to let a message [in the issues](https://github.com/priviere/PPBstats/issues) or to send me an email if

- some points are not clear in the vignette or you find bugs
- you find bugs with your data (If so, you can send it to me so that I can see where could be the problems)

### 2. Translate

The package is in english. 
Every contributions to other languages are welcome!
More informations on R package translation [here](http://developer.r-project.org/Translations30.html).


### 3. Add functions

If you have any ideas, 

- on the improvement of the current package
- on new functions to add based on analysis you carry out in your PPB trials
- ...

even if it is not R written, send me an email and we'll see how we can work together!
