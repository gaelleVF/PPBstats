\title{Check and format the data to be used by PPBstats functions}
\usage{
format_data_PPBstats(data, type = "data_agro", code, threshold, network_part,
  vertex_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data frame. See details.}

\item{type}{type of format : 
\itemize{
 \item data_network
 \item data_agro
 \item data_agro_version
 \item data_organo_napping
 \item data_organo_hedonic
 }
See details.}

\item{code}{For type = data_organo, data frame with code of samles. See details.}

\item{threshold}{For type = data_organo, number of occurence of descriptors <= threshold are kept}

\item{network_part}{For type = "data_network", element of the network, it can be "unipart" or "bipart"}

\item{vertex_type}{For type = "data_network",
\itemize{
 \item for unipart network : "seed_lots" or "location"
 \item for bipart network : c("germplasm", "location")
 }}

\item{network_split}{For type = "data_network" and network_part = "unipart" and 
vertex_type = "location", split of the data that can be "germplasm" or "relation_year_start"}
}
\value{
The function returns the data with the right format (i.e. class)

\itemize{
 \item For "data_network",
 \itemize{
  \item it returns a igraph object coming from igraph::graph_from_data_frame().
  \item for unipart network on location
  \itemize{
   \item for network_split = "germplasm", 
  it returns a list with as many elements as germplam in the data
  as well as all germplasms merged in the first element of the list.
  An atttribute with the number of seed_lots (nb_sl) for each location are added.
   \item for network_split = "relation_year_start", 
  it returns a list with as many elements as year in the data
  An atttribute with the number of seed_lots (nb_sl) for each location are added.
  }
  \item for bipart network, it returns a list with as many elements as year in the data 
  as well as all years merged in the first element of the list.
  If no year are provided into the data, all information are marged
 }
}

\description{
\code{format_data_PPBstats} checks and formats the data to be used by PPBstats functions
}
\details{
\itemize{
 \item For type = "data_network" : The data frame are different regarding type of network
 \itemize{
  \item for unipart network, two vertex_type are possible :
  \itemize{
   \item "seed_lots" : the data must have the following columns : 
   \itemize{
    \item "seed_lot_parent" : name of the seed lot parent in the relation
    \item "seed_lot_child" ; name of the seed lots child in the relation
    \item "relation_type" : the type of relation between the seed lots
    \item "relation_year_start" : the year when the relation starts
    \item "relation_year_end" : the year when the relation stops
    \item "germplasm_parent" : the germplasm associated to the seed lot father
    \item "location_parent" : the location associated to the seed lot father
    \item "year_parent" : represents the year of the last relation event of the seed lot father
    \item "germplasm_child" : the germplasm associated to the seed lot child
    \item "location_child" : the location associated to the seed lot child
    \item "year_child" : represents the year of the last relation event of the seed lot child
   }
   
   
   It can have in option : "alt_parent", "long_parent", "lat_parent",
   "alt_child", "long_child", "lat_child" to get map representation
   
   It can have supplementary variables with tags "_parent", "_child" or "_relation".
   
   \item "location" : the data can have two formats:
   \itemize{
    \item the same format than for unipart network and vertex_type = seed_lots
    \item the following columns (explained above): 
    "location_parent", "location_child"
    "relation_year_start", "relation_year_end"
    It can have in option : "germplasm_parent", "year_parent",
    "germplasm_child", "year_child"
    It can have in option : "alt_parent", "long_parent", "lat_parent",
    "alt_child", "long_child", "lat_child" to get map representation
    }
   }
  
  \item for bipartite network, the data can have two formats:
  \itemize{
   \item the same format than for unipart network and vertex_type = seed_lots
   \item the following columns : "germplasm", "location", "year"
   It can have in option : "alt", "long", "lat" to get map representation
  }
 }
 
 
 \item For type = "data_agro" : 
 It should have at least the following columns : c("year", "germplasm", "location", "block", "X", "Y", "..."), with "..." the variables.
 The variables can be linked to their corresponding dates. 
 The dates are associated to their corresponding variable by $.
 For example the date associated to variable y1 is y1$date.
 The date must have format year-month-day, e.g. 2017-12-05
 
 \item For type = "data_agro_version" : 
 It should have the following columns: c("year", "germplasm", "location", "group", "version").
 The group refers to an id that contains two different versions.
 For example for group 1, there is version 1 and 2. 
 See data(data_version) for an example.
 
 \item For type = "data_organo_napping"
 \itemize{
  \item data is a data frame with the following columns: sample, juges, X, Y, descriptors. 
  The descriptors must be separated by ";"
  \item code is data frame with the following columns germplasm, location, code.
  The function merge data and code to join the information.
 }

 \item For type = "data_organo_hedonic"
 
}
