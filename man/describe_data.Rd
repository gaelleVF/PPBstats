\title{Describe the data set in order to choose the appropriate analysis to carry out}
\usage{
describe_data(data, vec_variables, nb_parameters_per_plot = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data frame. It should have at least the following columns : c("year", "germplasm", "location", "block", "X", "Y", "..."), with "..." the variables.}

\item{vec_variables}{Vector of variables to describe}

\item{nb_parameters_per_plot}{Number of parameter on each histogram on the gird}
}
\value{
The function returns a list with,

\itemize{
 \item A summary of the whole data set
 \item for each variable, a list with :
  \itemize{
  \item A presence.abscence plot
  \item A list with histogram for
   \itemize{
    \item germplasm
    \item location
    \item year
    }
   For each element of the list, there are as many graph as needed with \code{nb_parameters_per_plot} parameters per graph.
  \item A list with boxplot, containg a list with plot and outliers, for
   \itemize{
    \item germplasm
    \item location
    \item year
    }
   For each element of the list, there are as many graph as needed with \code{nb_parameters_per_plot} parameters per graph.
   \item interaction
   For each element of the list, there are as many graph as needed with \code{nb_parameters_per_plot} parameters per graph.
