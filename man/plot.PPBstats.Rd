\description{
\code{plot.PPBstat_model_check} returns ggplot to visualize outputs from several functions
}
\details{
Below are some details on the construction of the plots :

\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{check_model}} from \code{\link{GxE}} :
  \itemize{
   \item variance_intra_germplasm represents the repartition of the residuals for each germplasm.
   This has to been seen with caution:
   \itemize{
    \item If germplasm have no intra-germplasm variance (i.e. pure line or hybrides) then the distribution of each germplasm represent only the micro-environmental variation.
    \item If germplasm have intra-germplasm variance (i.e. population such as landraces for example) then the distribution of each germplasm represent the micro-environmental variation plus the intra-germplasm variance.
    With the hypothesis than the micro-environmental variation is equaly distributed on all the individuals (i.e. all the plants), the distribution of each germplasm represent the intra-germplasm variance.
   }
 }

 \item \code{\link{check_model}} from \code{\link{model_1}} and \code{\link{model_2}}
 \itemize{
  \item mcmc_not_converge_traceplot_density : If you wish exhaustive information, look at \code{ggmcmc::ggmcmc} with \code{ggmcmc(out_model$MCMC)}.
  But be careful with the size of your MCMC output which are often too big to be performed in R.
 }

 \item \code{\link{biplot_GxE}}
  \itemize{
   \item which_won_where : plot to assess which germplasm win in which location.
   A polygon is drawn connecting germplasm which are located furthest away from the biplot origin such that all other entries are contained within the polygon;
   Perpendicular lines are drawn to each side of the polygon and start from biplot origin.
   A sector is the triangle area formed by two perpendicular lines.
   The germplasms which have the largest value in a sector "win" in the location present in that sector.
   The information is summarized in the legend of the plot.

   \item mean_vs_stability.
   It is a list of two elements where the plots are drawn under the same construction.
   A red circle indicates the position of the average location, which is defined by the average Dim1 and Dim2 scores across all locations.
   An arrow points this average 'virtual' location.
   A red line passes through the biplot origin and the average location (known as the Average-Tester Axis (ATA)).
   A red line is set perpendicular the ATA.
   Dashed perpendicular lines to the ATA are drawn and passed through each germplasm.

   \itemize{
    \item mean_performance : assess mean performance score of each germplasm.
    The mean performance score is the rank of germplasm along the ATA.
    The arrow points the greatest value according to their mean performance across all locations.
    An high score, represents an high mean performance.
    A low score reresents an low mean performance.
    Score are displayed into the legend.

    \item stability_performance : assess stability performance score of each germplasm.
    The stability performance score of the germplasms are represented by the projection from the germplasm to the ATA.
    An high score, represents an high interaction and therfore lower stability.
    A low score reresents an low interaction and therefore an high stability.
    Score are displayed into the legend.
   }

   \item discrimitiveness_vs_representativeness.
   It is a list of two elements where the plots are drawn under the same construction.
   A red circle indicates the position of the average location, which is defined by the average Dim1 and Dim2 scores across all locations.
   An arrow points this average 'virtual' location.
   A red line passes through the biplot origin and the average location (known as the Average-Tester Axis (ATA)).


    \itemize{
     \item discrimitiveness : assess discrimitiveness of each location.
     The score represents the discrimination : the higher the vector, the more discriminating the location.

     \item representativeness : assess representativeness of each location.
     The score represents the representativeness : the higher the score, the less representative the location.

     \item discrimitiveness_vs_representativeness :  represent discrimitiveness versus representativeness.
     The location combining better score (i. e.discrimination and representativeness) are the ones that could be used to test germplasms as they are more representative of all the locations.
     This has to be done severals year to get robust results.
     The highest the score, the more disciminative and representative the location.
    }
   }

 \item \code{\link{cross_validation_model_2}}
  \itemize{
   \item plot : plot estimated.value = f(observed.value).
   The probability mean = 0 is coming from a \code{t.test} performed with the null hypothesis H0: the bias of estimated values in relation to real values = 0.
