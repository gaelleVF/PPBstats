Within a Participatory Plant Breeding programme, it is important to give results back to the farmers in order to discuss and accompagny them in their selection.
This can be done through the creation of a report with results coming from the analysis.

This web site gives examples of reports to give back information to farmers based on analysis run with `PPBstats`.
Please refer to [PPBstats documentation](https://priviere.github.io/PPBstats_book) for more information, especially section regarding [communication to farmers](https://priviere.github.io/PPBstats_book/com.html).

The workflow to create the report follow three steps:

1. run the analysis and create a list with all results
2. create a `.Rmd` template that will be shared by all locations
3. run `rmarkdown::render()` in order to generate report for each location

For each example you have a dedicated page with the script used as well as links to download the template and see reports
