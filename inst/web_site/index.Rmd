# Key words
`R` package, Participatory Plant Breeding, statistical analysis

# Background
Participatory Plant Breeding (PPB) is based on the decentralization of evaluation and selection in the fields of farmers and gardeners [@desclaux_changes_2008]. 
All actors such as farmers, technicians, researchers, facilitators, consumers, ... are involved in the decision-making process at all stages of the PPB programme. 
Such kind of involvement empowers all actors and responds to their needs [@sperling_framework_2001]. 
During PPB programmes, experiments are carried out and different types of data are produced and must be analysed in order to support farmers in their selection. 
These data covers the history of seed management (circulation, mixture, reproduction, selection, etc), agronomic trials, organoleptic tests and molecular data. 
Several programmes exist to analyze these different types of data but they are not always freely available and often scattered in different softwares.

# Objectives of `PPBstats`
`PPBstats` is a freely available package based on the R software [@R_Core_Team] that performs analyses on the data collected during PPB programs at four levels: 

- network of seed management, 
- agronomic trials, 
- organoleptic tests and 
- molecular analyses. 

**The objectives of `PPBstats` are**

1. to have a single package capable of performing all analyses required for PPB programmes with comprehensive documentation, and 
2. to create a community working on PPB programmes in order to improve the package, exchange on how to process data from PPB programmes and develop good practices. 

# Examples of analysis performed by PPBstats

After a step of  data formatting a workflow of analysis is carried out. 
For network analysis, only descriptive methods are provided, and graphical representations are available.  
For agronomic analyses, decision trees are available in order to perform the most appropriate analysis depending to the objective and the experimental constraints such as number of plots or seed available. 
Descriptive analyses such as barplot, radar, boxplot, interaction plot, maps can be done. 
Several models such as spatial analysis, mixed model, bayesian hierarchical models, AMMI and GGE are implemented. 
For organoleptic data, hedonic and napping analyses can be performed. 
For each model, a function checks if the model went well and mean comparisons as well as biplots can be visualized. 
For molecular data, only descriptive plots on the markers are implemented.
