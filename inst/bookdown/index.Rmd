# Preface {-}

`PPBstats` is an R package that performs analysis found within PPB programmes regarding network of seeds circulation, agronomic trials, organoleptic tests and molecular experiments.

```
Be aware that this package is under development and test: do not 100% trust the functions!!! 
You're welcome to contribute: see section \@ref(contributions).

## Authors of `PPBstats` and the book, affiliation and contribution {-}

**Pierre Rivière^1^** coordinated the package development, wrote the R functions and the present book

**Gaelle Van Frank^2^** tested the package and updated the code regarding sections \@ref(ammi), \@ref(gge), \@ref(model-1), \@ref(model-2) and \@ref(variance-intra)

**Olivier David^3^** wrote the `JAGS` code and reviewed the R code and the book regarding sections \@ref(model-1), \@ref(model-2), \@ref(model-1) and \@ref(variance-intra).

**Facundo Muñoz^4^** reformated and improved all the code regarding S3 methods, format figures with `Tikz`, improve section \@ref(contributions) regarding contributions.

**Isabelle Goldringer^2^** reviewed and improved all the text of the book regarding agronomic sections

Le Réseau Semences Paysannes (the French Farmers' Seeds Network (RSP)), created in 2003, brings together a great diversity of collectives and people who preserve farmers' seeds in fields, orchards, vineyards and gardens. They are involved in supporting the consolidation of local initiatives to maintain and renew cultivated biodiversity through Community Seeds Systems. Over 90 organizations have come together to promote and develop farmers' seeds, and to protect farmers' rights over their seeds.

The Diversity, Evolution and Adaptation of Populations (DEAP) team led by Isabelle Goldringer is part of INRA UMR 0320 Quantitative Genetic and Evolution.
Its work is based on the analysis of the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms underlying evolution and adaptation of crop populations.
DEAP develops strategies for on farm management of crop genetic diversity and
for plant breeding (evolutionary and/or participatory) adated to organic and low input agriculture.
Assessing the benefits of in-field genetic diversity (variety mixtures, populations) and designing
/ breeding optimized mixtures adapted to local conditions are also key research objectives.

The INRA UR1404 MaIAGE research laboratory gathers mathematicians, computer scientists, bioinformaticians and biologists to tackle problems coming from biology, agronomy and ecology; The addressed questions may concern processes at very different levels: molecular, cellular or multicellular, individual, populations, ecosystems oy landscapes. 
MaIAGE develops original methods in mathematics, statistics and computer science which are generic or driven by specific biological problems. A particular attention is paid to develop and make available softwares, databases, ontologies and web services so that biologists can use them easily to analyze their data or to mine the scientific literature.
