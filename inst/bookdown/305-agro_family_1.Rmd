## Family 1 of analysis : Compare different varieties evaluated for selection in different locations. {#family-1}

**Family 1** gathers analyses that estimate entry effects.
It allows to compare different entries on each location and test for significant differences among entries.
Specific analysis including response to selection can also be done.
The objective to compare different germplasms on each location for selection.

### Decision tree

To compare different germplasms on each location for selection, different scenarios are possible (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-Compare-different-varieties-evaluated-for-selection-in-different-locations-agro)) :

- classic anova (**M4a**, section \@ref(classic-anova)) based on on fully replicated designs (**D1**, section \@ref(fully-replicated)),
- spatial analysis (**M4b**, section \@ref(spatial-analysis)) based on row-column designs (**D3**, section \@ref(row-column)),
- mixed models (**M5**, section\@ref(ibd-model)) for incomplete blocks designs (**D2**, section \@ref(ibd)),
- bayesian hierarchical model intra-location (**M7a**, section \@ref(model-1)) based on satellite-regional farms designs (**D4**, section \@ref(rf-sf)). 

It can be completed by organoleptic analysis (section \@ref(organoleptic)).
Based on these analysis, specific objective including response to selection analysis can also be done.

### Workflow and function relations in `PPBstats` regarding family 1 of analysis

Figure \@ref(fig:main-workflow-family-1) displays the functions and their relationships.
Table \@ref(tab:function-descriptions-workflow-family-1) describes each of the main functions.

You can have more information for each function by typing `?function_name` in your R session.
Note that `check_model()`, `mean_comparison()` and `plot()` are S3 method.
Therefore, you should type `?check_model`, `?mean_comparison` or `?plot.PPBstats` to have general features and then see in details for specific functions.
