## Family 1 of analysis : Compare different varieties evaluated for selection in different locations. {#family-1}

**Family 1** gathers analyses that estimate entry effects.
It allows to compare different entries on each location and test for significant differences among entries.
Specific analysis including response to selection can also be done.
The objective to compare different germplasms on each location for selection.

This can be done through (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-Compare-different-varieties-evaluated-for-selection-in-different-locations-agro)) :

- classic anova (**M4a**, section \@ref(classic-anova)) based on on fully replicated designs (**D1**, section \@ref(fully-replicated)),
- spatial analysis (**M4b**, section \@ref(spatial-analysis)) based on row-column designs (**D3**, section \@ref(row-column)),
- mixed models (**M5**, section\@ref(ibd-model)) for incomplete blocks designs (**D2**, section \@ref(ibd)),
- bayesian hierarchical model intra-location (**M7a**, section \@ref(model-1)) based on satellite-regional farms designs (**D4**, section \@ref(rf-sf)). 

It can be completed by organoleptic analysis (section \@ref(organoleptic)).
Based on these analysis, specific objective including response to selection analysis can also be done.
