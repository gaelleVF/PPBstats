## Introduction

Network of seed circulation are interesting to have insight on how exchanges are structured within a PPB programme or a Community Seed House (we prefere the term instead of Community Seed Banks[@bioversity_csb_2015]).
It can be done at several scale, for example local, regional and national.

Two types of network are handle within `PPBstats` :

- unipart network where a vertex can be
    - a seed lot (i.e. a combinaison of a germplasm in a given location a given year) where edges are relation such as diffusion, mixture, reproduction, crosses or selection for example.
    - a location where edges are diffusion between location

- bipart network where a vertex can be a location or a germplasm


### Workflow and function relations in `PPBstats` regarding network analysis

The workflow is very simple as only descriptive analysis can be done.

Figure \@ref(fig:main-workflow-network) displays the functions and their relationships.
Table \@ref(tab:function-descriptions-workflow-network) describes each of the functions.

You can have more information for each function by typing `?function_name` in your R session.

```{r main-workflow-network, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Main functions used in the workflow."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/PPBstats-main-functions-network.png")
```


| function name | description |
|---|---|
|`format_data_PPBstats` | Check and format the data to be used in `PPBstats` functions|
| `plot` | Build ggplot objects to visualize output |

### Data format {#data-network}

Three formats are possible:

1. unipart network for seed lots which represents relation between seed lots: a data frame with the followin compulsory columns:
    - `"seed_lot_parent"` : name of the seed lot parent in the relation
    - `"seed_lot_child"` ; name of the seed lots child in the relation
    - `"relation_type"` : the type of relation between the seed lots
    - `"relation_year_start"` : the year when the relation starts
    - `"relation_year_end"` : the year when the relation stops
    - `"germplasm_parent"` : the germplasm associated to the seed lot father
    - `"location_parent"` : the location associated to the seed lot father
    - `"year_parent"` : represents the year of the last relation event of the seed lot father
    - `"germplasm_child"` : the germplasm associated to the seed lot child
    - `"location_child"` : the location associated to the seed lot child
    - `"year_child"` : represents the year of the last relation event of the seed lot child

It can have in option : `"alt_parent"`, `"long_parent"`, `"lat_parent"`, `"alt_child"`, `"long_child"`, `"lat_child"` to get map representation.
It can have supplementary variables with tags `"_parent"`, `"_child"` or `"_relation"`.

2. unipart network for location which represents relation of germplasm diffusion between location: a data frame with the followin compulsory columns (explained above): `"location_parent"`, `"location_child"`, `"relation_year_start"`, `"relation_year_end"`.
It can have in option : `"germplasm_parent"`, `"year_parent"`, `"germplasm_child"`, `"year_child"`.
It can have in option : `"alt_parent"`, `"long_parent"`, `"lat_parent"`, `"alt_child"`, `"long_child"`, `"lat_child"` to get map representation.

3. bipart network for germplasm and location which represent "which location has which germplasm which year": a data frame with the followin compulsory columns: `"germplasm"`, `"location"`, `"year"`.
It can have in option : `"alt"`, `"long"`, `"lat"` to get map representation


Note that format 1. can be convert to format 2. and 3. as summarized in Table \@ref(tab:network-format-analysis).
When bipart network come from unipart network for seed lots, relation reproduction and diffusion are taken.

| | unipart for seed lots analysis | unipart for location analysis | bipart for germplasm and location analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
|unipart for seed lots format | X | X | X |
|unipart for location format | | X | |
|bipart for germplasm and location format | | | X |
Table: (\#tab:network-format-analysis) Possible analysis (in column) regarding network format (in row).

The format of the data are checked by the function `format_data_PPBstats()`. 

The following argument can be used :

- `type` : `"data_network"`
- `network_part` : `"unipart"` or `"bipart"`
- `vertex_type` :
    - for unipart network : `"seed_lots"` or `"location"`
    - for bipart network : `c("germplasm", "location")`
- `network_split` : for `network_part = "unipart"` and `vertex_type = "location"`, split of the data that can be `"germplasm"` or `"relation_year_start"`.


Possible values of argument regarding network format are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:network-format-arg).

| | `network_part` | `vertex_type` | `network_split` | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| unipart for seed lots format |  `unipart` or  `bipart` |  `seed_lots` or `location` or  `c("germplasm", "location")` |  `NULL` or `germplasm` or `relation_year_start` | 
| unipart for location format |  `unipart` |  `location` |  `germplasm` or `relation_year_start` |
| bipart for germplasm and location format |  `bipart` |  `c("germplasm", "location")` |  `NULL` | 
Table: (\#tab:network-format-arg) Possible values of argument (in colum) regarding network format (in row).

The following sections give exemples for each network format.
The function returns list of `igraph` object^[http://igraph.org/r/] coming from `igraph::graph_from_data_frame()`.


#### unipart for seed lots data
