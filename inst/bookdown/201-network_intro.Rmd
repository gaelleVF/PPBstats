## Introduction

Network of seed circulation are interesting to have insight on how exchanges are structured within a PPB programme or a Community Seed House (we prefere the term instead of Community Seed Banks).
It can be done at several scale : local, regional and national.

Two types of network are handle within `PPBstats` :

- unipart network where a vertex can be
    - seed lot (i.e. a combinaison of a germplasm in a given location a given year) that can be linked by several relation such as diffusion, mixture, reproduction, crosses or selection for example.
    - location that represent each diffusion between location

- bipart network where a vertex can be a location or a germplasm


### Workflow and function relations in `PPBstats` regarding network analysis

The workflow is very simple as only descriptive analysis can be done.

Figure \@ref(fig:main-workflow-network) displays the functions and their relationships.
Table \@ref(tab:function-descriptions-workflow-network) describes each of the functions.

You can have more information for each function by typing `?function_name` in your R session.

```{r main-workflow-network, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Main functions used in the workflow."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/PPBstats-main-functions-network.png")
```


| function name | description |
|---|---|
|`format_data_PPBstats` | Check and format the data to be used in `PPBstats` functions|
| `plot` | Build ggplot objects to visualize output |
Table: (\#tab:function-descriptions-workflow-network) Main function descriptions.


### Data format

Three formats are possible:

- unipart network for seed lots which represents relation between between seed lots: a data frame with the followin compulsory columns:
    - `"seed_lot_parent"` : name of the seed lot parent in the relation
    - `"seed_lot_child"` ; name of the seed lots child in the relation
    - `"relation_type"` : the type of relation between the seed lots
    - `"relation_year_start"` : the year when the relation starts
    - `"relation_year_end"` : the year when the relation stops
    - `"germplasm_parent"` : the germplasm associated to the seed lot father
    - `"location_parent"` : the location associated to the seed lot father
    - `"year_parent"` : represents the year of the last relation event of the seed lot father
    - `"germplasm_child"` : the germplasm associated to the seed lot child
    - `"location_child"` : the location associated to the seed lot child
    - `"year_child"` : represents the year of the last relation event of the seed lot child

It can have in option : `"alt_parent"`, `"long_parent"`, `"lat_parent"`, `"alt_child"`, `"long_child"`, `"lat_child"` to get map representation.
It can have supplementary variables with tags `"_parent"`, `"_child"` or `"_relation"`.

- unipart network for location which represents relation of germplasm diffusion between location: a data frame with the followin compulsory columns (explained above): `"location_parent"`, `"location_child"`, `"relation_year_start"`, `"relation_year_end"`.
It can have in option : `"germplasm_parent"`, `"year_parent"`, `"germplasm_child"`, `"year_child"`.
It can have in option : `"alt_parent"`, `"long_parent"`, `"lat_parent"`, `"alt_child"`, `"long_child"`, `"lat_child"` to get map representation.

- bipart network for germplasm and location which represent "which location has which germplasm which year": a data frame with the followin compulsory columns: `"germplasm"`, `"location"`, `"year"`.
It can have in option : `"alt"`, `"long"`, `"lat"` to get map representation


Note that format 1. can be convert to format 2. and 3. as summarized in Table \@ref(tab:network-format-analysis).
When bipart network come from unipart network for seed lots, relation reproduction and diffusion are taken.

| network format / analysis | unipart for seed lots | unipart for location | bipart for germplasm and location |
|---|---|---|---|
|unipart for seed lots | X | X | X |
|unipart for location | | X | |
|bipart for germplasm and location | | | X |
Table: (\#tab:network-format-analysis) Possible analysis regarding network format.

The format of the data are check by the function `format_data_PPBstats`. The following argument can be used :
- type = `data_network`
- network_part : `"unipart"` or `"bipart"`
- vertex_type :
    - for unipart network : `"seed_lots"` or `"location"`
    - for bipart network : `c("germplasm", "location")`
- network_split for network_part = "unipart" and vertex_type = "location", split of the data that can be "germplasm" or "relation_year_start"


Possible values of argument regarding network format are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:network-format-arg).

| network format / argument | network_part | vertex_type | network_split | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| unipart for seed lots |  `unipart` |  `seed_lots` |  NULL | 
| unipart for location |  `unipart` |  `location` |  `germplasm` or `relation_year_start` |
| bipart for germplasm and location |  `bipart` |  `c("germplasm", "location")` |  NULL | 
Table: (\#tab:network-format-arg) Possible values of argument regarding network format.

The following sections give exemples for each network format.
It returns a list with `igraph` object coming from `igraph::graph_from_data_frame()`.

#### unipart for seed lots
```{r}
data(data_network_unipart_sl)
head(data_network_unipart_sl)
```

- unipart for seed lots
```{r}
net_unipart_sl = format_data_PPBstats.data_network(
  data = data_network_unipart_sl, 
  network_part = "unipart",
