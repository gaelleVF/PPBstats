## Introduction {#intro-organo}

First, chose your objective (\@ref(objective-organo)), then the analyses and the experimental design based on a decision tree.

Finally see how to implement it based on the workflow and function relations (\@ref(workflow-organo)) from formated data (\@ref(data-organo)).

### Analysis according to the objectives {#objective-organo}
In order to compare different germplasms on each location for selection, three main objectives dealing with PPB programmes organoleptic analyses can be :

- **Understand and check consumers preferences**.
This can be done through hedonic analysis (section \@ref(hedonic)).

- **Characterize products sensory properties**.
This can be done through napping analysis (section \@ref(napping)).

- **Rank product according to few sensory descriptors**.
This can be done through rank analysis (section \@ref(rank)).


### Decision tree {#decision-tree-organo}

For each analysis, a decision tree is proposed (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-Compare-different-varieties-evaluated-for-selection-in-different-locations-senso)) based on the objective, the number of products and the number of tasters.
For all analysis, no training is needed for tasters.

```{r decision-tree-Compare-different-varieties-evaluated-for-selection-in-different-locations-senso, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Decision tree with experimental constraints, designs and methods of sensory analysis carry out in `PPBstats` regarding the objective : Compare different varieties evaluated for selection in different locations. **D** refers to designs and **M** to methods."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree_Compare-different-varieties-evaluated-for-selection-in-different-locations_senso.png")
```

Once you have chosen your objective, analysis and experimental design, you can taste and measure ... (section \@ref(taste)).


### Workflow and function relations in `PPBstats` regarding organoleptic analysis {#workflow-organo}

After designing the experiment and describing the data, each family of analysis is implemented by several analysis with the same workflow :

- Format the data
- Run the model
- Check the model and visualize outputs
- Compare means, format data for biplot and visualize outputs

Figure \@ref(fig:main-workflow-organo) displays the functions and their relationships.
Table \@ref(tab:function-descriptions-workflow-organo) describes each of the main functions.

You can have more information for each function by typing `?function_name` in your R session.

```{r main-workflow-organo, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Main functions used in the workflow."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/main-functions-organo.png")
```

### Data format {#data-organo}

For organoleptic analysis data must have a specific format.
Each format is displayed in the corresponding analysis section.
