## Family 2 of analysis : Study the response of varieties under selection over several environments {#family-2}

**Family 2** gathers analyses that estimate germplasm and location and interaction effects. 
This is to analyse the response over a network of locations. 
Estimation of environment and year effects is possible depending of the model. 
Specific analysis including migrant and residant can also be done.
It allows to study the response of germplasm over several location or environments.
The objectives is to study response of germplasm over several locations for selection.

### Decision tree

To study response of germplasm over several locations for selection, different scenario are possible (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-Study-the-response-of-varieties-under-selection-over-several-environments)) :

- AMMI and GGE (**M6**, sections \@ref(ammi) and \@ref(gge)) based on on fully replicated designs (**D1**, section \@ref(fully-replicated)),
- bayesian hierarchical model $G \times E$ (**M7b**, section \@ref(model-2)) based on satellite-regional farms designs (**D4**, section \@ref(rf-sf)),

It can be completed by specific analysis such as migrant-residant (section \@ref(migrant-residant)) which corresponds to a specific objective : study migrant and residant effect, where migrant in a location refers to a germplasm that has not been grown or selected in a given location and resident in a location refers to a germplasm that has been grown or selected in a given location.
