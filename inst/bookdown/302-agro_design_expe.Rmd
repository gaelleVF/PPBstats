## Design the experiment {#doe}

The experimental design are based on number of plots per location, the number of location, the replication of germplasm within and between locations.

Function `design_experiment` sets the experimental design based on :

- the number of entries
- the number of controls per block
- the number of blocks
- the number of columns in the design. The number of rows is computed automaticaly.

The function returns a list with

- a data frame
- an image of the experimental design

A description of the algorithm is describe in the help of the function: `?design_experiment`.

The four experimental designs are 

- D1 - fully-repicated
- D2 - incomplete block design
- D3 - row-colum
- D4 - satellite-farm and regional-farm

### Fully-replicated {#fully-replicated}

In fully replicated design, all entries are replicated into different blocks.

The decision tree where fully-replicated designs are used is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-agro-fully-replicated-design).

```{r decision-tree-agro-fully-replicated-design, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The decision tree where fully-replicated designs are used."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree_agro-fully-replicated-design.png")
```

The R code to implement is the following :

```{r}
p_fr = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-1",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "fully-replicated",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:20), sep = ":"),
  nb.blocks = 3,
  nb.cols = 4)
```

By default, the data frame is under a standard format:
```{r}
head(p_fr$"fully-replicated"$data.frame)
```


You can set the format to a `SHiNeMaS`^[Seeds History and Network Management System, see http://moulon.inra.fr/index.php/en/tranverse-team/atelier-de-bioinformatique/projects/181 for more details] reproduction template file:

```{r}
p_fr = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-2",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "fully-replicated",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:20), sep = ":"),
  nb.blocks = 3,
  nb.cols = 4,
  return.format = "shinemas")
```

```{r}
head(p_fr$"fully-replicated"$data.frame)
```


```{r}
p_fr$"fully-replicated"$design
```


### Incomplete Block Design {#ibd}

The decision tree where incomplete block designs are used is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-agro-ibd-design).

```{r decision-tree-agro-ibd-design, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The decision tree where incomplete block designs are used."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree_agro-ibd-design.png")
```

Entries are not replicated on a location. 
Some entries are shared by some locations.
Each block is an independent unit and can be allocated to different location.
It is also possible that some farms welcome several blocks.
Therefore, the experiment can be handle by several locations that can not welcome an high number of plots.

```{r}
p_ibd = design_experiment(
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "IBD",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:10), sep = ":"),
  nb.blocks = 8, # i.e. number of location if each location has one block
  nb.cols = 4)
```

```{r}
head(p_ibd$`IBD`$data.frame)
```


```{r}
p_ibd$`IBD`$design
```

### Row-column {#row-column}

In Row-column design, a control is replicated in row and columns to catch as much as possible of the variation.

The decision tree where row-column design are used is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-agro-row-column-design).


```{r decision-tree-agro-row-column-design, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The decision tree where row-column designs are used."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree_agro-row-column-design.png")
```


The R code to implement is the following :

```{r}
p_case2 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-3",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "row-column",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:20), sep = ":"),
  controls = "toto",
  nb.controls.per.block = 7,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 7)
```

```{r}
head(p_case2$"row-column"$data.frame)
```

```{r}
p_case2$"row-column"$design
```

Note that if controls are missing in rows or columns, the function will return an error message.
The controls must catch as much as possible of the trial variation.


### Regional and satellite farms {#rf-sf}

Regional farms must have several entries (i.e. a germplasm in an environment) in two or more blocks with some entries (i.e. controls) replicated in each block.
Satellite farms has no block and only one entry is replicated twice.
Farmers choose all entries that are not replicated.
The number of entries may vary between farms.
Note that at least 25 environments (location $\times$ year) are need in order to get confident analysis.

The decision tree where regional and satellite farms designs are used is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-agro-regional-and-satellite-design).


```{r decision-tree-agro-regional-and-satellite-design, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The decision tree where regional and satellite farms designs are used."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree_agro-regional-and-satellite-design.png")
```


The R code to implement is the following :

As an exemple here, six designs are generated: four for satellite farms and two for regional farms.

```{r}
p_case3_sf1 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-4",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "satellite-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:6), sep = ":"),
  controls = "toto",
  nb.controls.per.block = 2,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 2)
p_case3_sf1 = p_case3_sf1$`satellite-farms`$design
p_case3_sf1
```

```{r}
p_case3_sf2 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-5",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "satellite-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:6), sep = ":"),
  controls = "toto",
  nb.controls.per.block = 2,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 2)
p_case3_sf2 = p_case3_sf2$`satellite-farms`$design
p_case3_sf2
```

```{r}
p_case3_sf3 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-6",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "satellite-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:6), sep = ":"),
  controls = "toto",
  nb.controls.per.block = 2,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 2)
p_case3_sf3 = p_case3_sf3$`satellite-farms`$design
p_case3_sf3
```

```{r}
p_case3_rf1 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-7",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "regional-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:16), sep = ":"),
  controls = c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4"),
  nb.controls.per.block = 4,
  nb.blocks = 2,
  nb.cols = 4)
p_case3_rf1 = p_case3_rf1$`regional-farms`$design
p_case3_rf1
```

```{r}
p_case3_rf2 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-8",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "regional-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:16), sep = ":"),
  controls = c("c1", "c2", "c3"),
  nb.controls.per.block = 3,
  nb.blocks = 2,
  nb.cols = 3)
p_case3_rf2 = p_case3_rf2$`regional-farms`$design
p_case3_rf2
```

If you have enought space and lots of seeds, you can adapt the satellite farm design with only one column.
Each row beeing a sower width.

```{r}
p_case3_sf4 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-9",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "satellite-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:6), sep = ":"),
  controls = "C",
  nb.controls.per.block = 2,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 1)
p_case3_sf4 = p_case3_sf4$`satellite-farms`$design
p_case3_sf4
```


There some constraints regarding `expe.type = "satellite-farm"`:

- if `nb.entries > 10`, a warning message recommands to have less than 10 germplasms or to choose `expe.type = "regional-farm"`.
- There are two controls per block
- There is one block
- There are maximum two columns

For `expe.type = "regional-farm"`, there is a warning message if controls are missing in rows or columns.
It is better to catch as much as possible of the trial variation.
If there are less than 2 blocks, an error message is returned.
