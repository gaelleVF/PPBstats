## Design the experiment {#doe}

Function `design_experiment` sets the experimental design based on :

- the number of entries
- the number of controls per block
- the number of blocks
- the number of columns in the design. The number of rows is computed automaticaly.

The function returns a list with

- A data frame
- An image of the experimental design

A description of the algorithm is describe in the help of the function: `?design_experiment`.


### fully-replicated {#fully-replicated}

Decision tree where fully-replicated design are used is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:tree-fully-replicated).

```{r tree-fully-replicated, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Decision tree where fully-replicated design are used."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree-where-fully-replicated-design-are-used.png")
```

The R code to implement is the following :

```{r}
p_fr = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-1",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "fully-replicated",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:20), sep = ":"),
  nb.blocks = 3,
  nb.cols = 4)
```

By default, the data frame is under a standard format:
```{r}
head(p_fr$"fully-replicated"$data.frame)
```


You can set the format to a `SHiNeMaS`^[Seeds History and Network Management System, see http://moulon.inra.fr/index.php/en/tranverse-team/atelier-de-bioinformatique/projects/181 for more details] reproduction template file:

```{r}
p_fr = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-2",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "fully-replicated",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:20), sep = ":"),
  nb.blocks = 3,
  nb.cols = 4,
  return.format = "shinemas")
```

```{r}
head(p_fr$"fully-replicated"$data.frame)
```


```{r}
p_fr$"fully-replicated"$design
```



### row-column {#row-column}

Decision tree where row-column design are used is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:tree-row-column).


```{r tree-row-column, out.width='20%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Decision tree where row-column design are used."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree-where-row-column-design-are-used.png")
```


The R code to implement is the following :

```{r}
p_case2 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-3",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "row-column",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:20), sep = ":"),
  controls = "toto",
  nb.controls.per.block = 7,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 7)
```

```{r}
head(p_case2$"row-column"$data.frame)
```

```{r}
p_case2$"row-column"$design
```

Note that if controls are missing in rows or columns.
The function return an error.
The controls must catch as much as possible of the trial variation.


### Regional and satellite farms {#rf-sf}

Regional farms had several entries (i.e. a germplasm in an environment) in two or more blocks with entries replicated in each block.
Satellite farms had no block and one entry replicated twice.
Farmers chose the other entries to be sown that were not replicated.
The number of entries may vary between farms.
Note that at least 25 locations or environments (location $\times$ year) are need in order to get confident analysis.

Decision tree where regional and satellite farms design are used is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:tree-rf-sf).


```{r tree-rf-sf, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Decision tree where regional and satellite farms design are used."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree-where-regional-and-satellite-farms-design-are-used.png")
```


The R code to implement is the following :

Here, six designs are generated: four for satellite farm and two for regional farm.

```{r}
p_case3_sf1 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-4",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "satellite-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:6), sep = ":"),
  controls = "toto",
  nb.controls.per.block = 2,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 2)
p_case3_sf1 = p_case3_sf1$`satellite-farms`$design
p_case3_sf1
```

```{r}
p_case3_sf2 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-5",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "satellite-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:6), sep = ":"),
  controls = "toto",
  nb.controls.per.block = 2,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 2)
p_case3_sf2 = p_case3_sf2$`satellite-farms`$design
p_case3_sf2
```

```{r}
p_case3_sf3 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-6",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "satellite-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:6), sep = ":"),
  controls = "toto",
  nb.controls.per.block = 2,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 2)
p_case3_sf3 = p_case3_sf3$`satellite-farms`$design
p_case3_sf3
```

```{r}
p_case3_rf1 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-7",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "regional-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:16), sep = ":"),
  controls = c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4"),
  nb.controls.per.block = 4,
  nb.blocks = 2,
  nb.cols = 4)
p_case3_rf1 = p_case3_rf1$`regional-farms`$design
p_case3_rf1
```

```{r}
p_case3_rf2 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-8",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "regional-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:16), sep = ":"),
  controls = c("c1", "c2", "c3"),
  nb.controls.per.block = 3,
  nb.blocks = 2,
  nb.cols = 3)
p_case3_rf2 = p_case3_rf2$`regional-farms`$design
p_case3_rf2
```

If you have many space and many seeds, you can adapt the satellite farm design with only one column.
Each row beeing a sower width.

```{r}
p_case3_sf4 = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-9",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "satellite-farm",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:6), sep = ":"),
  controls = "C",
  nb.controls.per.block = 2,
  nb.blocks = 1,
  nb.cols = 1)
p_case3_sf4 = p_case3_sf4$`satellite-farms`$design
p_case3_sf4
```


There some constraints regarding `expe.type = "satellite-farm"`:

- if `nb.entries > 10`, a warning message recommand to have less than 10 entries.
- There are two controls per block
- There is one block
- There are maximum two columns

For `expe.type = "regional-farm"`, there is a warning message if controls are missing in rows or columns.
It is better to catch as much as possible of the trial variation.
If there are less than 2 blocks, an error is returned.

### Incomplete Block Design {#ibd}

Incomplete block design.
Entries are not replicated. Some entries are shared by some locations.
There is one block per location.

```{r}
p_ibd = design_experiment(
  location = "Location-9",
  year = "2016",
  expe.type = "IBD",
  germplasm = paste("germ", c(1:10), sep = ":"),
  nb.blocks = 8,
  nb.cols = 4)
```

```{r}
head(p_ibd$`IBD`$data.frame)
```


```{r}
p_ibd$`IBD`$design
```
