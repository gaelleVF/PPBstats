# Analysis of agronomic traits {#agronomic}

In section \@ref(intro-agro), you will chose your objective, the analyses and the experimental design based on a decision tree and see how to implement it based on the workflow and function relations from formated data.

Then, thanks to `PPBstats`, you will 

- design the experiment (section \@ref(doe)),
- sow, note, harvest, measure ... (section \@ref(sow))^[well, ok, `PPBstats` will not do it for you !!!],
- describe the data (section \@ref(describe-data-agro)),
- run statistical analysis (sections \@ref(family-1), \@ref(family-2), \@ref(family-3), \@ref(family-4) and \@ref(family-5))
