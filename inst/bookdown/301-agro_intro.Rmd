## Introduction

### Experimental design

Before sowing, you must plan the experiment regarding your research question, the amount of seeds available, the number of locations and the number of plots available in each location.

The trial is designed in relation to the analysis you will perform.
The key elements to choose an appropriate experimental design are:

- the number of locations
- the number of years
- the replication of entries within and between locations


Several designs used in PPB programmes are presented in section \@ref(doe) and are mentionned in decision tree in section \@ref(decision-tree).

Then, you can sow, measure and harvest ... (section \@ref(sow))


### Analyses carried out

After describing the data (section \@ref(describe-data-agro)), you can run statistical analysis.

Table \@ref(tab:summary-analysis) summarizes the analyses available in `PPBstats` and their specificities.
The various effects that can be estimated are:

- **germplasm**: a variety or a population
- **location**: a farm or a station where a trial is carried out
- **environment**: a combination of a location and a year
- **entry**: the occurence of a germplasm in a given environment or location
- **interaction**: interaction between germplasm and location or germplasm and environment
- **year**
- **migrant-resident**: migrant in a location refers to a germplasm that has not been grown or selected in a given location; resident in a location refers to germplasm that has been grown or selected in a given location.
- **version**: version within a germplasm, for example selected vs non-selected

The analyses are divided into five families:

- **Family 1** (section \@ref(family-1)) gathers analyses that estimate entry effects.
It allows to compare different entries on each location and test for selection.

- **Family 2** (section \@ref(family-2)) gathers analyses that estimate germplasm and location and interaction effects. 
This is to analyse the response over a network of farms. 
Estimation of environment and year effects are in option depending of the model. 
Specific analysis including migrant and residant can also be done.
It allows to study the response of germplasm over several location or environnements.

- **Family 3** (section \@ref(family-3)) correspond to combining family 1 and 2 analyses. 
This allows to analyse network of farms and to study the response of entries over several locations and environnements for selection.

- **Family 4** (section \@ref(family-4)) gathers analyses answering specific research questions. 
This is for analysis on one location or more.

- **Family 5** (section \@ref(family-5)) refers to multivariate analysis

The different models in Family 1 and 2 correspond to experimental designs that are presented in the next section \@ref(doe).

Analysis used in PPB programmes are mentionned in decision tree in Section \@ref(decision-tree).

#### Bayesian statistics {#section-bayes}

##### Theory

Some analyses performed in `PPBstats` are based on Bayesian statistics.

Bayesian statistics are based on the Bayes theorem:

$Pr(\theta|y) \propto Pr(\theta) Pr(y|\theta)$

with
$y$ the observed value,
$\theta$ the parameter to estimate,
$Pr(\theta|y)$ the posterior distribution of the parameter given the data,
$Pr(y|\theta)$ the likelihood of the observation and
$Pr(\theta)$ the prior distribution of the parameter.

The parameters' distribution, knowing the data (the posterior), is proportional to the distribution of parameters *a  priori* (the prior) $\times$ the information brought by the data (the likelihood).

The more information (i.e. the larger the data set and the better the model fits the data), the less important is the prior.
If the priors equal the posteriors, it means that there is not enough data or the model does not fit the data.

Bayesian inference is based on the posterior distribution of model parameters.
This distribution can not be calculated explicitely for the hierarchical model used in here (section \@ref(model-1) and section \@ref(model-2)) but can be estimated using Markov Chain and Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

These methods simulate parameters according to a Markov chain that converges to the posterior distribution of model parameters [@robert_bayesian_2001].

MCMC methods were implemented using `JAGS` by the R package `rjags` that performed Gibbs sampling [@robert_bayesian_2001].
Two MCMC chains were run independently to test for convergence using the Gelman-Rubin test.
This test was based on the variance within and between the chains [@gelman_inference_1992].

A burn-in and lots of iterations were needed in the MCMC procedure.
Here the burn-in has 1000 iterations, then 100 000 iterations are done by default
^[You can change it with the argument `nb_iterations` in functions `model_1` and `model_2`] with a thinning interval of 10 to reduce autocorrelations between samples, so that 10 000 samples are available for inference for each chain by default
^[There are `nb_iterations/10` values for each chain. This can be changed with the `thin` argument of the functions.]
The final distribution of a posterior is the concatenation of the two MCMC chains: 20 000 samples.


##### Mean comparisons {#mean-comp}

In this part, the mean of each entry is compared to the mean of each other entry.
Let $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$ denote the hypotheses:

$H_{0} : \mu_{ij} \ge \mu_{i'j} , \; H_{1} : \mu_{ij} < \mu_{i'j}$.

The difference $\mu_{ij}-\mu_{i'j}$ between the means of entry $ij$ and entry $i'j$ in environment $j$ is considered as significant if either $H_{0}$ or $H_{1}$ has a high posterior probability, that is if $Pr\{H_{0}|y\} > 1 - \alpha$ or $Pr\{H_{1}|y\}> 1 - \alpha$, where
$\alpha$ is some specified threshold.
The difference is considered as not significant otherwise.
The posterior probability of a hypothesis is estimated by the proportion of MCMC simulations for
which this hypothesis is satisfied (Figure \@ref(fig:proba)).

Groups are made based on the probabilites.
Entries that belong to the same group are not significantly different.
Entries that do not belong to the same group are significantly different.

The threshold $\alpha$ that depends on agronomic objectives.
This threshold is set by default to $\alpha=0.1/I$ (with $I$ the number of entries in a given location).
It corresponds to a `soft' Bonferroni correction, the Bonferroni correction being very conservative.

As one objective of this PPB programme is that farmers (re)learn selection methods, the threshold could be adjusted to allow the detection of at least two groups instead of having farmers choose at random.
The initial value could be set to $\alpha=0.1/I$ and if only one group is obtained, then this value could be adjusted to allow the detection of two groups.
In this cases, the farmers should be informed that there is a lower degree of confidence for significant differences among entries.

```{r proba, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean comparison between $\\mu_{ij}$ and $\\mu_{i'j}$"}
library(ggplot2)

nb = 100000
a = rnorm(nb, 55, 4)
b = rnorm(nb, 60, 4)
c = b - a

d1 <- with(density(a), data.frame(x, y))
d2 <- with(density(b), data.frame(x, y))
d3 <- with(density(c), data.frame(x, y))
d = rbind.data.frame(d1, d2, d3)
n = c(rep("mu_ij", nrow(d1)), rep("mu_i'j", nrow(d2)), rep("mu_i'j - mu_ij", nrow(d3)))
d = cbind.data.frame(d, n)

p = ggplot(data = d, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, color = n))
p = p + geom_area(mapping = aes(x = ifelse(x<0 , x, 0)), fill = "red")
p = p + geom_area(mapping = aes(x = ifelse(x>0 & x<30 , x, 0)), fill = "gold")
p = p + geom_line(size = 2)
p = p + ylim(0,0.11) + theme(legend.position="none")

d_text = data.frame(
  n = c("mu_ij", "mu_i'j", "mu_i'j - mu_ij", "H1", "H0"),
  x = c(mean(a)-mean(a)/5, mean(b) + mean(b)/5, mean(c), -4, 4),
  y = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.075, 0.005, 0.005)
  )

p = p + geom_text(data = d_text, aes(x = x, y = y, label = n), size = 6) + theme_bw() + ylab("density") + xlab("")
p = p + theme(legend.position="none") + geom_abline() + scale_color_manual(values = c("#000000", "#000000", "#E69F00", "#009E73", "#CC79A7"))
p

# library(latex2exp)
# n = c(TeX("$\\mu_ij$"), TeX("$\\mu_i'j$"), TeX("$\\mu_i'j - \\mu_ij$"), "H1", "H0")

```

In `PPBstats`, mean comparisons are done with `mean_comparisons`.
You can choose on which parameters to run the comparison (`parameter` argument) and the $\alpha$ type one error (`alpha` argument).
The soft Bonferonni correction is applied by default (`p.adj` argument).
More informations can be obtain on this function by typing `?mean_comparisons`.


### Decision tree {#decision-tree}

For each family of analysis, a decision tree divided in five levels is proposed (Figure \@ref(fig:tree)):

- Family of analysis
- Number of plots per location
- Number of locations and years
- Relevant experimental design
- Statistical analysis

The corresponding decision trees are displayed in section \@ref(doe) regarding design of experiments. 
Decision tree for Family 1 is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:tree-f1).
Decision tree for Family 2 is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:tree-f2).

```{r tree, out.width='20%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Levels in the decision tree for analysis in `PPBstats`."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree-for-analysis-in-PPBstats.png")
```

```{r tree-f1, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Decision tree regarding Family 1."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree-regarding-Family-1.png")
```

```{r tree-f2, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Decision tree regarding Family 2."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/decision-tree-regarding-Family-2.png")
```


### Workflow and function relations in `PPBstats` regarding agronomic analysis

After designing the experiment and describing the data, each family of analysis is implemented by several analysis with the same workflow :

- Format the data
- Run the model
- Check the model and visualize outputs
- Compare means and visualize outputs

Note that for model 2 and GGE other analyses are possible : predict the past and cross validation regarding model 2 and biplot regarding GGE.

Figure \@ref(fig:main-workflow) displays the functions and their relationships.
Table \@ref(tab:function-descriptions-workflow) describes each of the main functions.

You can have more information for each function by typing `?function\_name` in your R session.

```{r main-workflow, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Main functions used in the workflow."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/PPBstats-main-functions-agro.png")

### Data format

For `data-agro`, there are two format supported : `data-agro` and `data-agro-version`.

#### `data-agro`

`data-agro` format corresponds to all the data set used in the functions that run models.
The data have always the following columns : location, year, germplasm, block, X, Y as factors followed by the variables and their corresponding dates.
The dates are associated to their corresponding variable by `$`.
For example the date associated to variable `y1` is `y1$date`.

```{r}
data("data_GxE")
data_GxE = format_data_PPBstats(data_GxE, type = "data_agro")
head(data_GxE)
class(data_GxE)
```

#### `data-agro-version`

`data-agro-version` format corresponds to a specfic data set with pairs of entries in a given location. 
It is then possible to compare pairs of entries in a given location.
This is useful if you want to compare two versions within a group.

The data must have the following columns: year, germplasm, location, group, version as factors.
The group refers to an id that contains two different versions.
For example for group 1, there are version 1 and 2.
Within each group, there must have different version and different germplasm (i.e. each version must have different germplasms.).


```{r}
data(data_version)
data_version = format_data_PPBstats(data_version, type = "data_agro_version")
head(data_version)
```

Here, in location `env1-1`, `tem-1` and `tem-2` are two versions belonging to the same groupe.
