## Family 5 of analysis : multivariate analysis {#family-5}

Multivariate analysis can answer to multiple objective.
On of then can be to study diversity structure and identify parents to cross based on either good complementarity or similarity for some traits (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-Study-diversity-structure-and-identify-complementary-or-similar-parents-for-cross)).
It can be completed by analysis of molecular data and genetic distance trees (**M3**, section \@ref(molecular)).
